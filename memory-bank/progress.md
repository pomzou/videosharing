# Progress Report

## Task: Manage Expiration of Signed URLs
- Implemented expiration management for signed URLs using the `expires_at` column in the `video_shares` table.
- Updated the `VideoShareController` to check for expiration in the `accessVideo` method.
- Verified that the `isExpired()` method in the `VideoShare` model correctly checks the expiration status.
- Confirmed that the `VideoShareExpirationTest` includes tests for the expiration functionality, ensuring that access is denied for expired shares.

## Current Status
- All required functionality for managing signed URL expiration is implemented and tested successfully.
